# Magical-Error-Reporting
What is this error message
The purpose of this question is to use a recursive algorithm to write a program that calculates 1+2+3++ 100 (all addends are integers, and the latter number is 1 greater than the previous number)
I know this program cannot be implemented, but this error is very strange
